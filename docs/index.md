# GOLD: the Gawk Object Layor

Gold adds  the following goodies to standard Gawk:

-         multi-line comments.
-          encapsulation
-          objects, 
-          attributes
-          methods
-          polymorphism
-          inheritance (of attributes and methods)
-          iterators
-           unit tests
-           documentation tools

Interestingly,  most of that comes from:

- [13 lines of a Gawk transpiler](https://github.com/timm/gold/blob/master/gold.awk#L13-L26)
from Gold code into the standard Gawk syntax.
- About [25 lines of runtime support](https://github.com/timm/gold/blob/master/gold.awk#L28-L52)
  code.
