# Superheros!

## Why acknowledge software heroes?

Research results

## But is it wrong to call you "hero"?

There are many things we could have called you (rockstar, champion,
 leader, maniac,
evangelist, martyr, visionary, god...)  but those words came with
too many other connotations.  

And we thought about a more gender-neutral
term but then found [numerous recent publications](http://bit.ly/2UhJCek)
that use it to denote admired people of all genders.  

Also, truth
to tell,  we got worried about being beaten up
by 
of Shuri,
Gamora, Storm, Wonder Woman, the Wasp, Jean Grey, Spider Gwen, Captain
Marvel, Supergirl, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Jessica Jones,... 
Go on, you tell them they are not heroes. See how far that gets you.

Finally, the word 
"hero" is shorter than nearly all the other options.
So congrats: you are a hero!

## Superheros make Great Stories

Superheroes:

- Use document to explain their code.
- Use test cases to let other people check, maintain, and extend their code.
  Also, some (small) subset of the tests
  are actually "demos" that show off an insightful and exciting feature of the code.
- Use on-line version control systems so everyone can access their work, then 
  update it with better versions.

Why?

Well, here's the thing about superheroes--
other people eagerly tell the story
of their accomplishments.
Now the story of a software superhero is written into code
and people are most eager to
share code that  tells a  super-heroic story
of defeating some hard problem, in an elegant and inspiring manner.
Reading such code is be insight and  inspiring and
makes you race to grab a keyboard (so you can try out that idea for yourself).

These stories-in-code are exciting stories. They have a purpose, a mission.
They attack a problem,  clearly show were that attack fails or succeeds,
and leaves you begging for more. 
The results you obtain from today's
code should suggest all manner of new possibilities (for the future).
As Susan Sontag said 
"the only interesting answers are those that destroy the questions".
So superheroes live in a perpetually changing world where the tools
of today are forever reforming tomorrow.

But superheroes understand responsibility.  You do not just save the
day then fly away. The stories you write must go on, even when you are not there.
So  super heroes write code as simply and as clearly as they can,
so others
can extend your stores once you go.
